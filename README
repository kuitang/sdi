# Getting Started

## Install Dependencies
You need [xdebug](http://xdebug.org/download.php) for development installed.
All other packages are installed in ./lib

Or if you have PECL,
  pecl install xdebug

There are various configurations that point to /~kuitang/sdi as the application
root. If you are running on a different environment, change those:
  - In .htaccess
  - In  system/application/config/config.php 

Also, make sure you create the system/cache and system/log directories set to be
writable by the web server. They are not included in the git repository.

The file system/application/sid.sqlite needs to also be writable on by server.

You need PHP5 with sqlite3 support.
